  about: `I'm a Frontend engineer based in Cotonou, Benin.

  I'm a frontend developer who likes to play and draw with colors in code. My goal is to provide the
  most beautiful and easy-to-use interfaces for startups' websites and applications. I've been working
  towards this goal for the past three (03) years on a number of projects that I invite you to discover.
   The technologies I masterinclude HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, tailwind CSS, Laravel, Wordpress, Vue JS and Electron JS. Hence,
   I have successfully completed several web projects from scratch. 
   Yet, I learn continuously and never stop exploring new technologies.
   So, I have also gained knowledge of Astro JS, SCSS and more.
